Project to analyze CrossFit Open data for Data Science Nanodegree project 1.


Questions to answer

1) What is the ideal height and weight of a male and a female to perform well in the CrossFit Open?
    a) Does this change when it is just 18-35 years? Masters and teen athletes?
    b) Does this change from the 2019 Open to the 2020 Open?
    
2) For workous one thru five, what height and weight duo faired better on each workout?

3) What percentage of each country has athletes at the ideal height and weight?


For questions 1 and 2, I will remove any row that has a 0 value for the workout since it drops their overall score.

For question 3, I will not remove any row that has a 0 value for the workout since the workout results aren't needed
to determine the count of each ideal sized athlete in a country.
